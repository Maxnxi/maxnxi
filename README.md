## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Maksim, an iOS Developer with a passion for creating engaging social networking applications. With years of experience under my belt, I have honed my skills in **Swift**, **Objective-C**, and **C++**. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve developed dozens unique applications and collaborated with various teams across different projects, which has enriched my understanding of the development process.

Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into rendering photos and videos and leveraging GPU-based calculations to enhance app performance. I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies, so I regularly engage in discussions about programming and share insights with fellow developers.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on advanced image and video rendering techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about GPU programming and optimization.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects, especially in the realm of social networking.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Swift development, GPU calculations, or any coding challenges you face!
